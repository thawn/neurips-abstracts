# Changelog for NeurIPS Abstracts

create markdown files in this directory to document changes made to the NeurIPS Abstracts project. Each file should follow the naming convention `<unique_increasing_number>_<short_description>.md` and include concise information about the changes, including features added, bugs fixed, and any relevant notes for users or developers.

## Finding the Right Number

To determine the next unique increasing number for your changelog file, check the existing files in the `changelog` directory and identify the highest number used. Increment that number by one for your new file. For example, if the highest existing file is `95_JAVASCRIPT_UNIT_TESTS_FIXED.md`, your new file should start with `96_`.
